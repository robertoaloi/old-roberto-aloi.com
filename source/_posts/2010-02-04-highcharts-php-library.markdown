You might have heard about <a
href="http://www.highcharts.com/" target="_blank">Highcharts</a>. Reading from its
official documentation:

> "Highcharts is a charting library written in pure JavaScript,
  offering an easy way of adding interactive charts to your web site
  or web application".

<strong>highcharts-php</strong> is a PHP library created to ease interaction
with the Highcharts JS charting library from PHP. It provides
utility functions which auto-generate Highcharts JS code starting from
some PHP data.

Please note that the highcharts-php project is not directly releated
to the Highcharts one.

The <strong>highcharts-php </strong>library is available for free
download from GitHub.
