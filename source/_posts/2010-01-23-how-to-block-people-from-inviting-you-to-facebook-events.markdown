Never had a friend or someone continuously inviting you to parties and
all that kind of events having place in the opposite part of the world
and in which you're not interested at all? Did you kindly ask to these
guys and to their friends not to invite you anymore and they didn't
listen to you?

Well, <strong>it is possible</strong> to prevent them from sending you
event invitations, without the need of blocking them.

Simply access your Facebook account and do the following:

* Click on Settings -&gt; Privacy Settings
* Under <code>Block Lists</code>, click on <code>Edit Your Lists</code>
* Under <code>Block Event Invites</code>, add the names of your
* spammer friends

Now enjoy your Facebook account without spammers. Hope this
helps. Thanks to Adrian for his suggestions.
