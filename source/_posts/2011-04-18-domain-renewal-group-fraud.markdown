A couple of days ago the following letter has been delivered to my British postal address:

TODO (http://aloiroberto.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/domain-fraud.png)

It's a letter regarding the renewal of an expiring Internet domain, some sort of reminder. So, why should one be surprised by the fact that an Internet Domain Provider is kind to its customers and that it sends reminders about expiring domains? Well, because the _Domain Renewal Group_ is *not* sending reminder to _its own_ customers and because the letter reveals a fraudulent business model apparently followed by several Domain Providers out there. Let's take a step back and explain things in order.

Suppose you own an Internet domain, such as _roberto-aloi.com_. The domain normally has an expiry date associated, which is publicly visible via a <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whois">whois</a> operation. A dishonorable Domain Provider crawls  a series of web domains, identifying the ones which are about to expire and extracting the postal address of the domain holders, which in most of the cases is part of the public information accessible via _whois_. The provider then sends a letter to the domain holder. The letter is presented as a "courtesy to domain name holders" and a "reminder that your domain name registration is due to expire in the next few months". The domain holder, when receiving the letter, doesn't realize that in reality the letter is not about a renewal operation but about a completely new contract with a completely new domain provider, so he authorizes the payment.


Please note that the above business model is not simply _immoral_ since it's all about stealing customers from competitors, but it's also _illegal_. In fact, the _whois_ terms and conditions explicitely prohibit the use of the _whois_ data for:

> [...] advertising, direct marketing, marketing research, or similar purposes.

You've been warned.
